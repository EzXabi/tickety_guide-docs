### Step 2: Customise your Bot (Optional)

After you have clicked on create you will be in the `General Information` tab of your new application. Here you can give your app (Bot) an icon that be used as its avatar in discord.
You can also give your app a description which is visible to users of your discord when they select or view the profile of your Bot.

### Step 3: Configure App Installation

We now need to go to the `Installation` tab in the app configuration to set up the installation method. These settings can cause errors if not configured correctly, so please be sure to check these settings;

- **User Install:** `Unchecked`
- **Guild Install:** `Checked`
- **Install Link:** `None`

### Step 4: App configuration on Discord

Next head to the `Bot` tab in the app configuration and scroll down ensuring each of these are set correctly;

- **Public Bot:** `Disabled`
- **Server Members Intent:** `Enabled`
- **Message Content Intent:** `Enabled`

### Step 5: Configuring your Bot on the Tickety Dash

Don't worry, you are doing great and almost done. Just a couple of more things and your ready to go.

Head to your [Tickety Dashboard](https://tickety.top/dashboard) and head to the `Personalizer` tab for your server. Once you are there, fill out the token for your bot.

You obtain this from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the `Bot` tab. You will see a button called **Reset Token** click this and copy the new token.

Once you have done this make sure you have the Custom Bot enabled on the Tickety Dashboard and then click the Invite button. After you have done this just check to make sure it is on your discord server, has the neccesary permissions and responds to commands. If all of that is good you can safely remove the Tickety labelled bot.
