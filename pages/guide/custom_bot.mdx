### Step 2 Customise your Bot (Optional)

After you have clicked on create you will be in the `General Information` tab of your new application. Here you can give your app (Bot) an icon that be used as its avatar in discord.
You can also give your app a description which is visible to users of your discord when they select or view the profile of your Bot.

### Step 3 App configuration on Discord

Next head to the `Bot` tab in the app configuration and scroll down ensuring each of these are set correctly;

- **Server Members Intent:** `Enabled`
- **Message Content Intent:** `Enabled`

### Step 4 Configuring your Bot on the Tickety Dash

Don't worry, you are doing great and almost done. Just a couple of more things and your ready to go.

Head to your [Tickety Dashboard](https://tickety.top/dashboard) and head to the `Personalizer` tab for your server. Once there fill out the token info for your Bot.

You obtain this info from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the `Bot` tab. You will see a button called **Reset Token** click this and copy the token info.

Once you have done this make sure you have the Custom bot enabled on the Tickety Dash and then click the Invite button. After you have done this just check to make sure it is on your discord server, has the permissions and responds and if all is good you can safely remove the Tickety labelled bot.
